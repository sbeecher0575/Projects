# Stephen Beecher Code Samples

### latex_sample.Rmd

This file is an excerpt from a recent homework assignment (Theory of Probability), as an example of my knowledge of LaTex. Since these are answers to questions not listed, the math may not make much sense, but this is directed towards my use of LaTex to create tables, functions, etc. rather than my knowledge of statistics. The knit .pdf of the R Markdown file is also included in this repository.

### r_sample_plots.R

This file is a sample of some plots I have made in R, both randomly generated from distributions and from online data. I use both base R plotting and ggplot2 frequently.

### r_sample_stats.R

This file is an example of using R as a method to simulate data with statistical algorithms.

### r_sample_regression.Rmd

This is an example of my use of regression to analyze data in different ways. I used fixed and random effects, generalized linear models, and log models to accomodate for different anomalies in the data.

### r_sample_survey.R

This file uses lines of code from my previous project about the American National Election Study (ANES). Becuase the data file is too large to put onto this repository, the code from this file will not run, because it is missing the data. However, this project was a large part of my knowledge base for survey analysis and large-scale data management, so I thought I would include some of it. In this project I used base R mostly, but I am also familiar with using the Tidyverse to analyze data in R.

### writer-bot.py

This is one of my python programs, which takes an input .txt file and outputs a .txt file of randomly generated text using a Markov chain algorithm trained by the input file.

### writer-bot-ht.py

This program is extremely similar to writer-bot.py, but it is object oriented and uses hashtables instead of random number generation to achieve the randomness in the markov chain. It is slightly less efficient than writer-bot.py, but it uses more advanced coding techniques, so I wanted to include it in here.
